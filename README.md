# Cinema Timetable

This is created to link a spreadsheet file to a webpage which updates the div content from the linked spreadsheet. The content displayed in the div's is dependant on the date/time. The purpose of this is to automate the digital signate throughout the campus by allowing javascript code to run and execute. Upon execution of this script, the h1 elements within the div sections will change film title and film background image - depending on the date of the screenings.
